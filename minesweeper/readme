A minesweep game with auto-solution. (Auto solution algorithm may need to be imporved).
When you start, you will face too options: level and paintstyle. Different paintstyle gives you different impressions.

Note: opencv need to be installed before compiling.
Compile environment: Visual Studio. (Gcc should be OK, but I haven't tried)
